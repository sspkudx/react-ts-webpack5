# React TS Webpack Starter

This project is forked from [`solid-ts-webpack5`](https://github.com/Allen-Bayern/solid-ts-webpack5), with all settings adjusted for React.

This is a very basic starter kit. It includes a minimal TypeScript setup with webpack and webpack dev server. The CSS preprocessor `sass` and its loader, along with some useful loaders and plugins, have been added. This repository is an ideal starting point if you plan to build your own webpack configuration.
